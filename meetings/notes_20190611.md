# OS weekly meeting

Tuesday 11/06/19

## Attendees

- @zaibon
- @maxux
- @leesmet
- @delantj
- @muhamadazmy

## Progress Update

### Core X:

@maxux:

- When choosing interactity mode, you get your container with corex inside, this needs more privileges
- When corex starts, it drop privileges when ready
- Need to check: need to ensure everything is umount correctly at the end (no permissions anymore)

### Control Life Cycle of Service

@muhamadazmy:

- Update on zinit
- Two commands in the PR
  - No needs for `null` value for `log` option
- Need a way to get logs from a node, without having access to the node

### Container Module

@zaibon:

- Extracted flist manipulation from container module, no more internal dependency
- Flist module does his job and just returns root, containers start with a rootfs argument

### Upgrade Module

@zaibon:

- Upgrade module needs some review from others
- Need to figure out how upgrade module will start and stop services
- Get a zosv2 running somewhere and trying to keep it updated using upgrade for real

### Zbus

@leesmet:

- Zbus Rust implementation
- Issue with msgpack implementation in Rust, not compatible with Go implementation
- Maybe we need to change for a langage supporting this in a more reproducable way
- Encoded struct in Go is not unpacked correctly in Rust

@zaibon:

- Maybe going back to protobuf ? FlatBuffers ?
- Need to open an issue to find a good/better serialization protocol

## Expectation for this week

- We need good progress on the network (@zaibon, @delantj)
  - Need to sync with kds to be all inline with all we need, want and how
  - Check how to implement all we need and what's possible
  - Maximum flexibility for container network
  - Network spec needs to be provided, even if you want specific stuff
  - Network module itself should just apply specification, nothing more
  - Configuration is made by the 3bot before
  - Need more discussion
  - Need early PoC working to get basic networking working inside a container
- Storage implementation needs improvements (@muhamadazmy):
  - Moving back to Go, since Rust is blocked by Zbus implementation
  - Get for example, library to manipulate btrfs
  - How are we going to prepare volume, etc. properly
- zflist tools extension to get file manipulation (@maxux)
