# Explorer

The explorer is the component that is responsible to host all the public information about the nodes running 0-OS, the farms, the users identity and the capacity reservations.

The explorer exposes both a web UI and a REST API. 

- The web UI allows users to discover all the nodes and farms in the grid.
- The API is used by nodes and users.
